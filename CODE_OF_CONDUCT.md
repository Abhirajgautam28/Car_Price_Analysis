Code of Conduct

This project follows a professional and inclusive code of conduct. We expect contributors and maintainers to be respectful, collaborative, and constructive.

Standards

- Be respectful and courteous in communication.
- Assume good intent and ask for clarification rather than making accusatory statements.
- Keep discussions focused on technical and project-related issues.
- Do not engage in harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory behavior.

Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code of conduct, report it to `abhirajgautam28@gmail.com` with relevant details (dates, participants, and any supporting evidence). Reports will be handled promptly and confidentially.

Consequences for unacceptable behavior will be determined on a case-by-case basis by project maintainers.
