CONTRIBUTING
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository. This document describes the process for proposing changes, reporting issues, and submitting pull requests. Contributions are welcome from anyone who follows the guidelines below.

How to contribute
-----------------

1. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch name, for example `feature/add-feature-x` or `fix/preprocessing-bug`.
2. Keep changes focused and small — one change per pull request when possible.
3. Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Use the present tense, reference an issue when relevant, and include why the change was made.
4. If you add code, follow the existing style and include tests where appropriate.
5. Update documentation when public behavior or APIs change (README, notebook explanations, or docs).

Branching and pull requests
---------------------------

- Base branch: `main`.
- Create a topic branch for your work and push it to your fork.
- Open a pull request against `main` with a clear title and description describing the change and motivation.

Code review expectations
------------------------

- PRs will be reviewed for clarity, correctness, and adherence to repository conventions.
- Maintainability: reviewers may request changes before merging.
- Keep an eye on automated checks (if present) and address feedback promptly.

Issue reporting
---------------

When reporting an issue, include the following where applicable:

- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce and expected vs observed behavior.
- Environment details (Python version, OS, relevant package versions).
- Attach logs or screenshots if they clarify the problem.

Style and testing
-----------------

- Follow PEP8 for Python code. Keep code simple and readable.
- Prefer explicit, well-documented code over clever shortcuts.
- We encourage adding minimal tests for bug fixes or new behavior.
